/**

 *
 *   Level A — the distributable artifact. A collection, an execution environment, a
 *             skill. You push, pull, tag, sign, govern and promote these. That is
 *             `ContentObject`.
 *
 *   Level B — the content items inside an artifact. Modules, plugins, roles, playbooks,
 *             rulebooks. You document, search and reference these. They have no
 *             independent lifecycle — you cannot promote a module without promoting the
 *             collection that ships it. That is `Enumeration`.
 *
 * Trust and governance attach at Level A only. Discovery operates at both.
